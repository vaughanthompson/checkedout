                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">What is the benefit of having a Building Inspection Report before I place an offer?</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>You want to know the property has been independently checked out first so you can decide if you want to make an offer, and if that offer is subject to anything discovered during the inspection.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately the current model and process is broken. Reports are so costly and buyers are so desperate to get their offer accepted quickly, the due diligence usually waits until buyers are in the conditional period.</p>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">How does a CheckedOut MSIP report fix the broken house purchase process?</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>The current <strong>broken</strong> house purchase process works like this: </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You view and you want the property, you might even get to see a free Vendor's Building Report (but you know you can't trust and can't rely on it and will have to book your own inspection).</li>
                        <li>You then begin your due diligence and start checking out the property. <strong>It's now too late to set the contract aside without incurring additional due diligence costs and legal fees costing upwards of $2000.</strong></li>
                        <li>The No.1 reason a Sale &amp; Purchase contract falls over is because of an issue found in the builders report.</li>
                        
                    </ol>

                    <br>

                    <h5>How CheckedOut fixes this</h5>
                    <p>It's a model that provides the most important information about your potential new home <strong>BEFORE</strong> you make an offer and <strong>BEFORE</strong> you sign a contract.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our MSIP reports guarantee you get trustworthy, independent information before you've signed. You know for sure if there are any building issues and you can make an informed decision on how to proceed with your offer. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">How will getting a building report before I make an offer, save me thousands of dollars?</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>Checking it out first with a building report will identify issues quickly so you can make an informed decision to either continue with making an offer or stop and move on to looking at other properties. The #1 reason that house sales fall over is due to building report issues.</p>
                    <p>Having the most important information before having your offer accepted will eliminate the need to not only put yourself through all the Due Diligence effort, costing upwards of $2000 or more, but it will also eliminate the risk of being 2 or 3 weeks in limbo and out of the buyer's market.</p>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">Why can I trust and rely on MSIP reports, but I can't trust a vendors building report?</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>MSIP building reports can be verified as impartial, having been independently sourced, inspected and written by an inspector who has NO affiliation with the owner or real estate agent selling the home.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">What are the problems with current vendor building reports?</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p><strong>Unregulated.</strong> They are not regulated and not subject to any legislation requiring impartiality. Therefore anyone can inspect a property, offer their opinion and provide a written building report for the vendor, whether they are suitably qualified or not!</p>
                    <p><strong>Not impartial.</strong> Often the inspector providing vendor based reports is acquainted to the vendor or agent. In many cases this 'inspector' is a builder NOT a specialized building inspector- producing what is known in the real estate industry as "soft building reports."</p>
                    <p>A vendor sourced report that isn't subject to an independence process such as ours can- even unknowingly, have vendor bias attached to it.</p>
                    <p><strong>No insurance.</strong> The report is in the vendor's name therefore the 'privy of contract' exists only between them and the inspector. No ability for recourse exists for insurance claims against the inspector by buyers using this type of report.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">Does the Real Estate Authority (REA*) not permit or disallow soft building inspections?</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>Unfortunately, the current lack of regulation around building inspections, means soft building inspections remain a common practice for vendor building reports, and as a result the REA steps in and tells Real Estate Agents what to do and what to say. </p>

                    <p class="small">*The REA are the Independent Government agency that regulates the New Zealand Real Estate Industry - they issue Agents their licences and tell Agents what they must do and how they practice. The Building Inspection Industry is not regulated. This means Agents must follow the rules and provide the best advice but there are no rules for Inspectors. </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">What do the REA advise Real Estate Agents in regards to vendor building reports? </a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>The REA requires all real estate agents to tell potential homebuyers when there is a vendors building report available. They recommend the potential buyer order & book their own building inspection report on this same property. MSIP building reports save you time and this expense.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">Are CheckedOut MSIP building reports insurable?</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>YES! Thanks to our independent approach, inspectors are willing and able to transfer buyer's names (readdress) onto reports to enable you to seek insurance cover for the report contents.</p>

                    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You will have to check with your respective bank and insurer, but most banks will accept a building report if they can verify they are independent building reports. Banks won't generally accept the vendor's building report for the exact reasons and will require you to book your own building inspection.</p>

                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">How can I trust and rely on an MSIP building report that has been paid for by the vendor. Isn't it still an untrustworthy report? </a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>No. Because an MSIP report follows a process that eliminates the concerns regarding impartiality, un-insurability and bias. <a href="/ourprocess">See how it works.</a></p>

                        <li>Buyers know they can trust your MSIP report - the benefits you are providing to the Buyer are real and transparent and this builds trust in the relationship.</li>

                        <li>Allows buyers to check out your home quickly and seriously, compared to a seller who does not provide an MSIP report.
                        </li>
                        <li>Buyers can verify the MSIP report is trustworthy and rely on the reports contents to make an offer or bid and don't need to order their own report.
                        </li>
                        <li>MSIP inspection model shares the cost of the MSIP inspection with potential buyers, so you only pay a small portion of the MSIP report cost.
                        </li>
                        <li>Buyers appreciate you making the commitment to an MSIP inspection, and its transparency encourages buyers to share the cost of your inspection.
                        </li>
                        <li>Fast sale of your home at the priced you hoped for - and no surprises, no re-negotiation, and no chance of the sale falling over due to building issues.
                        </li>
                        <li>An immediate advantage over any seller who provides just a vendor's building report without the MSIP independence verification.</li>

                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">I had to buy my own builders report when I purchased my home - why should I provide a report for buyers now? </a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>In today's world people expect to be able to research everything online at the touch of a button and property information is no different.  By helping a buyer checkout your home in a fast, cost-effective way with a trusted MSIP building report, you are helping your chances of getting a fast, carefree sale of your home at the price you wanted.</p>
                    <p>This gives you a big advantage over a seller who only has a basic vendors building report available that buyers can't rely on or trust. (and who are left having to get their own building inspection) </p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger"> I've heard that because my home was not built in the leaky buildings era I don't need to get a Building Report?*</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>Not true! And not the point of getting an Independent MSIP report before you list. It's also just lazy advice and missing the #1 reason for getting this trustworthy information - and that reason is so you can PREPARE.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any property can have a building issue needing attention, examples include electrical, plumbing, structural, ventilation, hail damage, earthquake damage, land issues, and any of these can happen in a 12-month-old house as easily as in a 100-year-old one.</li>
                        <li>You need the information an MSIP report provides to know the condition of your home, so you can discuss with you Agent about an accurate listing price.</li>
                        <li>You need the information an MSIP report provides to 'front-foot' any issue, meaning knowing it first gives you the advantage to fix before listing (or at least be able to tell potential buyers it will be fixed before sale, or the listing price reflects the issues identified- so there's no need for costly re-negotiations on the price later.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="small">*Buildings that have a high risk of leaking were mostly built between the late 1980s and the mid-2000s, using plaster-style monolithic cladding systems.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">I know my house will sell anyway, so I will just take my chances and let the buyer get their own building inspection on my home?</a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>Of course, that is entirely up to you, however:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>You won't maximise your price</strong> - yes, in a hot market it will sell but if you can attract even more buyers to increase the competition and maximise your price, wouldn't you want to do that?  The reality is you only have to spend a small amount on an MSIP Building Inspection before you list so your potential buyers can use and trust the information. Plus, the inspection will probably end up costing you nothing anyway as buyers will be sharing the cost of the report with you.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Loss of control</strong> - by going down this route you do open yourself up to being at the mercy of the buyer, whereas an MSIP report that is trusted and relied on by a buyer provides you the home seller, peace of mind and control over the sale process. You will know that because you and the buyer are using the same report with the same information, you will have no surprises and therefore you remain in control of the sale process and any negotiations.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>High Risk</strong> -The obvious problem with a plan not to get an inspection report, is that you do run the risk of the buyer finding multiple problems with your home in their building report (these problems may be small, but they also may be large) but do require attention or money off your sale price. Don't put yourself in that high-risk situation that will reduce your sale price.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <ul>
                        <li>They want information they can trust and use</li>
                        <li>They want the information fast so they can save time and make decisions faster</li>
                        <li>They want and are happy to share the costs of this information, but they must be able to rely on it.</li>
                        <li>They want the new MSIP option they can trust - they have only ever had the un-reliable vendor reports option.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

            <div class="showHideContainer">
                <a href="#" class="showHideTrigger">How does MSIP get me, the homeseller what I want? </a>
                <div class="showHideDetail">
                    <p>You want a Sale at the highest price, and you want it quickly. MSIP reports speed up the process in a transparent and measured way.</p>

                    <p>When you purchase your MSIP report before you go on the market, you are doing everything in a logical order:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You find out before you list if there are any building issues</li>
                        <li>You then have the 1 report everyone uses and trusts - no surprises</li>
                        <li>You then share the costs of that information with your potential buyers.</li>
                        <li>Your potential buyers are loving the cost-effective, trustworthy information.</li>
                        <li>More potential buyers will get on board, appreciate your transparency, and will make more offers.</li>
